# Electric Vehicle Analysis

## Project Overview
This project aims to understand the landscape of electric vehicles, encompassing both Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs). The goal is to assess the market's size, growth, and the technological advancements of the EVs.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is `Electric_Vehicle_Population_Data.csv`. It includes information about electric vehicle models, their specifications, sales numbers, customer reviews, and more.

## Problem Statement
The key performance indicators (KPIs) for this project are:

1. **Total Vehicles**: Understand the overall landscape of electric vehicles to assess the market's size and growth.
2. **Average Electric Range**: Determine the average electric range of the electric vehicles in the dataset.
3. **Total BEV Vehicles and % of Total BEV Vehicles**: Identify and analyze the total number of BEVs in the dataset and calculate their percentage relative to the total number of electric vehicles.
4. **Total PHEV Vehicles and % of Total PHEV Vehicles**: Identify and analyze the total number of PHEVs in the dataset and calculate their percentage relative to the total number of electric vehicles.

## Visualizations
The following charts will be created as part of this project:

1. **Total Vehicles by Model Year (From 2010 Onwards)**: A line/area chart illustrating the distribution of electric vehicles over the years.
2. **Total Vehicles by State**: A map chart showcasing the geographical distribution of electric vehicles across different states.
3. **Top 10 Total Vehicles by Make**: A bar chart highlighting the top 10 electric vehicle manufacturers based on the total number of vehicles.
4. **Total Vehicles by CAFV Eligibility**: A pie/donut chart illustrating the proportion of electric vehicles that are eligible for Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle (CAFV) incentives.
5. **Top 10 Total Vehicles by Model**: A tree map highlighting the top 10 electric vehicle models based on the total number of vehicles.

## Tools Used
